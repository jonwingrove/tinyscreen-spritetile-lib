Optimised &amp; fast TinyScreen sprites and tiles

# features
* draw a number of sprites to TinyScreen, with optional alpha masking and horizontal flip
* use a tilemap to draw a background to the TinyScreen
* uses line-by-line buffered writes to the screen for maximum efficiency & zero overdraw / flicker
* sprites stored in program memory

# next steps
